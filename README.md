Â¡Hola!, I am a physics student from **Colombia** and data scientist aspiring. I'm currently expanding my knowledge into Python, SQL, Machine learning and data analysis. I am passionate about building innovative and useful analytical projects, and always looking to learn new skills and take on challenges.

On this profile, you will find a selection of my personal and professional projects. Each project has its own readme with detailed information and instructions on how to run and use the code.

Please feel free to take a look around and contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
